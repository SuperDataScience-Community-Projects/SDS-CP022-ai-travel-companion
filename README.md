# Project Scope of Works:

## Project Overview

This project involves creating an advanced AI-powered travel companion that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide personalized travel assistance. The project will gather the latest ticket price data from airlines through web scraping, integrate this data with a knowledge base, and deploy the final application on Hugging Face Spaces. The AI Travel Companion will offer users dynamic ticket pricing, travel recommendations, and query-based assistance.

## Objectives

### Data Collection and Storage:
- Gather data on popular travel destinations via web scraping.
- Store the data in a structured database optimized for quick retrieval.

### AI Travel Companion Development:
- Develop a RAG pipeline that combines a travel destinations knowledge base with generative AI.
- Implement functionality to answer user queries and provide personalized travel suggestions based on travel data and other contextual inputs.

### Application Deployment:
- Build an intuitive user interface for the travel companion.
- Deploy the application on Hugging Face Spaces for global accessibility.

## Technical Requirements

### Tools and Libraries:
- **Data Collection:** BeautifulSoup, Selenium, requests.
- **Data Storage:** csv, json or vector database.
- **AI Development:** LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API, Pinecone/FAISS/ChromaDB for vector search.
- **Application Deployment:** Gradio or Streamlit for user interface development; Hugging Face Spaces for hosting.

### Environment:
- Python 3.8+
- Required Libraries: pandas, langchain, transformers, gradio, openai, beautifulsoup4, selenium.
